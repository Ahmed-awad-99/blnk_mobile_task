# blnk_mobile_task

A new Flutter project.

Overview:
A cross-platform mobile app built using Flutter & Dart to collect user information and scan both sides of the National ID, following the Figma design.
Implemented Features:
User form:
First Name, Last Name, Detailed Address, Landline, Mobile
Capture National ID images (front & back) using camera
Form validation and clean UI
Google Sheets & Drive integration structure prepared
Not Implemented:
ID card contour detection & cropping: images are captured but not automatically cropped
National ID number extraction (OCR): not implemented
Proposed solutions: Use OpenCV or ML Kit OCR for automatic cropping and text extraction.
Notes:
Focus was on UI, form validation, and app architecture. Advanced image processing and OCR can be added later.
